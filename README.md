# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset using PyTorch

## Overview of the Dataset
* The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class.
* There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
* The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images.
* The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.
* The classes of the dataset are :
1. airplane
2. automobile
3. bird
4. cat
5. deer
6. dog
7. frog
8. horse
9. ship
10. truck
